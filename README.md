## ✅ How I Approach Each Problem

1. 📖 Understand the problem statement
2. ✏️ Write a brute-force solution first
3. 🧠 Optimize using efficient algorithms & data structures
4. ⏱ Analyze time and space complexity
5. ✍️ Document approach and edge cases

## 🌱 Why I'm Doing This

"Discipline is choosing what you want most over what you want now."

Coding daily not only improves technical skills but also strengthens focus, grit, and growth mindset. This challenge is not just about DSA — it's about **becoming the person who never gives up**.
